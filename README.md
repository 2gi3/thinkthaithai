this is still a WORK IN PROGRESS,
#### DRAFT DEPLOY: https://thinkthaithai.vercel.app/ 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## developer's notes:
-NVM 18.0.0

-All SCSS partials are imported (@forward) into index.SCSS, then the /styles directory is imported (@use "/styles" as *) into the specific SCSS files.

- All files in the /pages directory refer to SCSS files in the /styles directory.
-All files in the /components subdirectories have their own SCSS file in the same /component subdirectory
