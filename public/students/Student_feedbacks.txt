Khruu Nat's lessons have always been entertaining and fun. I always like the fact that when Khruu Nat would spend time knowing what you do usually and teaching according to Thai words and phrases for me to learn more.

Learned some basic pronunciation with Teacher Natt in my first trial class. Feel relax and comfortable when talk to Teacher. Thank you and can’t wait to start the full lesson.

I have been studying with Natt for a while. Natt is very friendly and patient, giving me the impression of the smiling country of Thailand. The lessons are taught in English from the beginning, and later are taught in full Thai! (I sincerely recommend that you have to keep the frequency of classes if you can. 2~3 classes per week are very effective, and your listening will increase instantly.) Because I don't like the typical learning style, Natt shares some current events in Thailand, Thai culture, or interesting advertisements, videos, etc. every time. We chat to learn words (take notes every time) and enhance listening and speaking. If it is too fast or too difficult to understand, you can tell Natt directly. She will speak slowly in a simple and slow way. Regardless of whether you have a basic knowledge of Thai or not, I highly recommand you can take a class with Teacher Natt!
